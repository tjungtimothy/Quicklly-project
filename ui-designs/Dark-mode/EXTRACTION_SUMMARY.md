## Naming Convention

All extracted screens follow this naming pattern:

```

Where:
- `{Category_Name}` = Sanitized category name with underscores
- `{NN}` = Two-digit sequential number (01, 02, 03, etc.)

## Technical Details

### Extraction Method
- **Algorithm:** Advanced boundary detection using image analysis with intelligent wide-screen splitting
- **Color/Brightness Analysis:** Detects gaps between screens based on uniform background colors
- **Wide Screen Handling:** Automatically splits screens wider than 450px into individual mobile-sized screens
- **Extreme Width Detection:** Forces splitting for screens >1000px wide to ensure proper mobile dimensions
- **Fallback Strategy:** Aspect ratio-based splitting for tightly packed screens
- **Padding:** 2-8px padding added to ensure no component truncation

### Quality Assurance
✓ All screens extracted with complete components  
✓ No truncation or cropping of UI elements  
✓ Wide composite screens properly split into individual screens  
✓ All screens maintain typical mobile dimensions (300-450px width)  
✓ Original image quality preserved  
✓ Optimized PNG compression applied  

### Screen Dimensions
- Screens maintain typical mobile widths (300-450px)
- Heights range from ~739px to ~2093px based on content
- All screens properly sized for mobile implementation
- No excessively wide screens remaining
